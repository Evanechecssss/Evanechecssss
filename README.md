### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Russian programmer, but not Siberian, âœ¨Uralsâœ¨. ðŸ’–

## How did I get to know the code? 

I always wanted to create my own game, but all my attempts failed and I had no ideas, but because of that I studied programming and learned to work with information and content.
Now I'm developing mods for the game meinecraft, making orders. 
I plan to study neural network and shaders, but my level of math doesn't let me do that and I don't have time for that yet. 

## Contact
In general, I can fuck up that I'm cool, but really cool google. You can write me. 
I have a site git hub io with contacts (_I haven't finished it_), I don't mind communicating, I think we'll get along)))
