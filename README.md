### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Russian programmer, but not Siberian, âœ¨Uralsâœ¨. ðŸ’–
For some reason I have hidden my repositories. Right now I am not working on projects and code, please understand me...

## How did I get to know the code?
I always wanted to create my own game, but all my attempts failed and I had no ideas, but because of that I studied programming and learned to work with information and content.
Now I'm developing mods for the game minecraft, making orders. 
I plan to study neural network and shaders, but my level of math (and I'm lazy.) doesn't let me do that and I don't have time for that yet.
